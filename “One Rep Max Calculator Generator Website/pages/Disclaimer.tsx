      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Lifting heavy weights and testing one-rep maxes carries an inherent risk of injury. We strongly recommend that you consult with a qualified medical professional before starting any new exercise program. Always perform high-intensity lifts with a qualified spotter or in a safety rack.</p>
